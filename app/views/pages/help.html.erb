<%= app_name %> helps you answer important questions about your
ancestry.
It is named for my Uncle Lloyd, who gave me the straight information on our
family, despite the cautions of his wife, Aunt Ruth (who furnished a lot of
good information herself).

I'm assuming you use genealogy software of some kind to manage your research
and that the software allows you to export a set of ancestors (or descendants)
to a GEDCOM file.
GEDCOM is a standard file format supported by most genealogy software -- read
up on it in your software's documentation if you have never exported a GEDCOM
file before.
</p>
<p>Follow these steps to use <%= app_name %>:
  <ol>
    <li>Sign up for a free user account.</li>
    <li>Use your genealogy program to choose the people you want to analyze
    and export them in a GEDCOM file.</li>
    <li>Upload the GEDCOM file to your 
    <%= if signed_in? then 
          link_to "Profile page", current_user
        else 
          "Profile page" 
        end %>.
    </li>
    <li>Click the link on your Profile page to analyze your GEDCOM.
    A page will open showing the beginning of your GEDCOM.
    Don't worry if you don't understand what is displayed here --
    all GEDCOMs look like this!
    This is just confirmation that your GEDCOM was uploaded OK.
    </li>
    <li>Clink the link for the report you are interested in:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Birthplaces Report</strong>.  Where were the people in the
      GEDCOM born?
      </li>
      <li><strong>Delete GEDCOM</strong>.  Well, this isn't a report but it
      allows you to delete the GEDCOM.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>Birthplaces Report</strong> has a row for each birthplace.
      To roll up the birthplaces into a more compact form, click the 
      <strong>Birthplaces Rollup Report</strong> 
      link at the bottom of the report.  For example, if you have five separate
      rows beginning with "Germany", the rollup report will have just one row
      for "Germany".
    </li>
  </ol>
