# Uncle Lloyd: a GEDCOM application

This is an application to help genealogy hobbyists answer typical questions
about their research findings, such as:
- Where are your ancestors from?
- How many generations have you traced back?

Written by Gary Hines, August 2011.

The application design is mainly based on concepts from the book 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).
